**Enhancing Sales Performance through Advanced Data Analysis in Amazon's Sales Management** 
In the competitive landscape of modern commerce, effective sales management is crucial for commercial and business enterprises to thrive. As competition intensifies and the need for more efficient distribution methods grows, businesses must find innovative ways to reduce costs and increase profits. Sales management, therefore, stands as the most critical function within these enterprises, requiring robust data analysis and strategic decision-making. This study aims to leverage an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process on an Amazon dataset to analyse sales trends and uncover key metrics and factors influencing sales performance. **By examining monthly, yearly, and combined yearly monthly sales trends, we seek to identify meaningful relationships between various attributes, such as product categories, pricing, customer demographics, and seasonal variations.** The insights derived from this analysis will inform strategic decisions to optimize sales management, enhance distribution efficiency, and ultimately drive profitability.
